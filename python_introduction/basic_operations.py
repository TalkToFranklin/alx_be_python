#this is a program that performs addition, subtraction, and multiplication on numbers 1 & 2.

#First we define the variables
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Calculate the sum, difference, and product
addition = number1 + number2
subtraction = number1 - number2
multiplication = number1 * number2

# Print the results
print(f'Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {addition}')
print(f'Subtraction of {number1} and {number2} is {subtraction}')
print(f'Multiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {multiplication}')
